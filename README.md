# Discord SHOUT!

A very simple FoundryVTT module that automatically tells your players on Discord when the world is open via Discord webhooks. With this module enabled you can't secretly work on your world, but if you don't mind your players showing up while you're prepping & working on their characters, then this module is for you.
